🎉 Fun Fact
I recently built a **Virtual Rakhi App** for the Indian festival of Rakhi. Since I was at the hostel, I created a link for my sister where she could upload her picture and leave a short note. When she pressed the "Tie Rakhi" button, it simulated the experience of tying a virtual rakhi for me. It was a fun way to celebrate the festival despite being far apart!
